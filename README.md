An easy way to toggle the sleep behavior of macOS devices

macOS operating system makes it hard for MacBook users to use external monitors and close the lid of their device without charging the device. With the help of Apple Shortcuts, I have made it easy for mac users to easily toggle sleep behaviors. Just disable the sleep function of the device by toggling the shortcut and connect to an external monitor and close the lid of your device. After you are done with your monitor, toggle the shortcut back.

The shortcut is available on: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c7633c7f24e64d80876b4639aea43e64
